# A-Quick-Guide-on-Radiology-Image-Pre-Processing-for-Deep-Learning-Applications-in-Prostate-Cancer-Re
Deep neural networks has achieved major breakthroughs during the past few years in almost all fields. There are plenty of publicly available algorithms, each designed to address a different task in computer vision in general. However, most of these algorithms cannot be directly applied to the medical imaging domain. To employ such algorithms for clinical purposes, we must make a meaningful pixel/voxel representation from medical images which facilitates the learning process. Based on the ultimate goal expected from the algorithm (classification, detection, or segmentation), one can infer the required pre-processing steps that can ideally improve the performance of the algorithm. This article introduces the required pre-processing steps for CT and MR images of prostate cancer patients in detail supported by relevant experiments which may be used by those new to the medical imaging field.
